# Exoplanet Cataloguer

Exoplanet Cataloguer is a Java application that allows astronomy researchers to maintain their own catalog of exoplanets, helping them in their cataloguing, classification and research.

The application relies on a purpose-built OWL-DL ontology that describes the domain of exoplanet study and research.

This project has been realized as an exam project of the Modeling and Knowledge Management course 2022/23 of the computer science department of the University of Camerino, held by professors Michele Loreti, Lorenzo Rossi and Andrea Morichetta.
